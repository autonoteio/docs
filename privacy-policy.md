# Autonote Privacy Policy

_Last updated: November 15, 2025_

Setout Labs LLC ("Setout Labs", "we", "us") operates the Autonote applications for iOS, Android, and web (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard personal data, and outlines the choices and rights available to you.

We align this Policy with the privacy requirements published by Apple App Store Review Guideline 5.1 and Google Play User Data policies. By using the Service, you agree to the practices described here. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of Autonote.

## Data We Collect

We collect the minimum personal data needed to provide Autonote and keep your workspace in sync across devices.

### Account and Authentication

When you create or sign in to an Autonote account we process your name (if provided), email address, hashed password or authentication tokens, profile photo, timezone, and preferences. If you sign in with Apple, Google, Facebook, or another provider we receive the identifier, name, and email they confirm for you.

### Workspace Content You Add

We store the notes, notebooks, tags, templates, attachments, voice recordings, and other content you upload so that it stays synced across your devices. This also includes metadata such as timestamps, collaborators, and version history.

### Device and Usage Data

We automatically collect device type, operating system version, app version, language, IP address, time zone, unique identifiers generated by us, and interactions with product features to secure the Service and understand performance.

### Diagnostics, Analytics, and Logs

We use Mixpanel to understand feature usage and Sentry to capture crashes and performance diagnostics. These services receive device identifiers and event metadata; they do not access the contents of your notes.

### Purchases and Subscriptions

If you buy a subscription, Apple, Google, and Superwall share transaction identifiers, product selections, subscription status, and country information with us so that we can activate your benefits. We do not receive your full payment card details.

### Support and Communications

When you contact support, respond to surveys, or submit feedback we collect the information you provide together with any attachments, timestamps, and contact details so we can respond.

### Push Notifications

If you enable push notifications we store a device token provided by Apple or Firebase to deliver alerts you request. You can disable notifications at any time in your device settings.

We do not intentionally collect precise geolocation, contacts, or sensitive personal data unless you include it in your content or choose to share it with us.

## How We Use Personal Data

We use personal data to:

- Provide, maintain, personalize, and improve the Service, including syncing your content across devices.
- Authenticate you, manage your account, and deliver the features you request.
- Process purchases, manage subscriptions, and communicate billing or entitlement updates.
- Send important notices such as security alerts, transactional emails, and policy updates.
- Provide customer support and respond to feedback or feature requests.
- Monitor usage, perform analytics, and develop new features while balancing product performance and user experience.
- Protect against fraud, abuse, and technical issues and enforce our Terms of Service.
- Comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal processes.

We only send marketing communications with your consent, and you can unsubscribe at any time.

## How We Share Personal Data

We do not sell or rent your personal data. We share it only with trusted service providers that help us operate Autonote:

- Supabase and PowerSync, which host our databases, authentication, and sync services and store the content you choose to add.
- Mixpanel, to measure product usage trends using event metadata so we can improve the Service.
- Sentry, to monitor crashes and application performance for troubleshooting.
- Superwall together with Apple App Store and Google Play billing, to process subscription purchases and verify your entitlement status.
- Firebase Cloud Messaging and Apple Push Notification service, to deliver push notifications to your devices.
- Vendors that provide infrastructure, logging, customer support, and email services under contractual confidentiality obligations.

We may disclose information to comply with law, defend our legal rights, prevent harm, or in connection with a corporate transaction such as a merger or acquisition.

We may publish aggregated or de-identified insights that do not identify you.

## Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK)

If you live in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we process personal data under the following legal bases:

- Contract: to provide the Service you request, including syncing your notes and processing purchases.
- Legitimate interests: to maintain, improve, and secure Autonote when those interests are not overridden by your rights.
- Consent: for optional analytics, marketing communications, or when you connect a third-party account.
- Legal obligations: to comply with accounting, tax, and regulatory requirements.
- Protection of vital interests or legal claims.

---

## Data Retention and Storage

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to provide the Service, meet legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Your notes, attachments, and related metadata remain while your account is active. When you delete content, we remove it from active systems and schedule it for deletion from backups within a reasonable timeframe.

Server logs and analytics summaries are kept for a limited period to secure the Service. Aggregated or anonymized data that no longer identifies you may be retained longer.

---

## International Data Transfers

We store and process data in the United States and other countries where our service providers operate.

When personal data is transferred internationally we rely on safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses, contractual commitments, and technical controls to protect your information.

By using Autonote you understand that your data may be transferred to jurisdictions with different data-protection rules than your home country.

## Your Rights and Choices

Depending on where you live, you may have the right to:

- Access, review, or obtain a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
- Request corrections or updates to inaccurate or incomplete information.
- Request deletion of certain personal data, subject to legal exceptions.
- Object to or request restriction of processing in certain circumstances.
- Withdraw consent or change your marketing and analytics preferences.
- Receive your information in a portable format.
- Opt out of sale or sharing of personal data; we do not sell personal data and we only share it to deliver the Service.

To exercise these rights, use the in-app controls described below or contact us at `support@autonote.io`. We may request information to verify your identity and authorized agents may submit requests for California residents with proof of authority.

## Account Deletion and Data Management

You control your account and content at any time:

- In the Autonote app, open Settings and tap “I want to delete my account” to permanently delete your account in compliance with Apple and Google requirements.
- Deleting your account removes your notes, tags, templates, attachments, and device tokens from active systems within a reasonable period (usually within 30 days) unless we must retain certain records for legal obligations.
- Signing out or uninstalling the app removes the locally cached data stored in SQLite on that device. To clear offline copies on other devices, sign out or uninstall Autonote there as well.

You can also delete individual notes or attachments directly inside the app. For additional help, or to request deletion of your account and associated data if you no longer have access to the app, email us at `support@autonote.io`.

## Children's Privacy

Autonote is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we learn that a child under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction) has provided personal data, we will delete it. Parents or guardians who believe a child has provided data should contact us.

---

## Security

We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards—including encryption in transit, access controls, secure development practices, and continuous monitoring—to help protect personal data.

No security controls are perfect, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. Please keep your account credentials confidential and notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access.

---

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements.

If we make material changes, we will provide notice through the app, by email, or other appropriate means before the updated policy becomes effective. The “Last updated” date at the top of this page reflects the most recent revision.

Please review this Privacy Policy regularly. Continuing to use Autonote after changes take effect means you accept the revised policy.
