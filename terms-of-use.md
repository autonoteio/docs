_Last updated: December 5, 2025_

These Terms of Use (the "Terms") govern your access to and use of the Autonote applications for iOS, Android, and web, and any related websites, services, and features (collectively, the "Service") operated by Setout Labs LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Setout Labs", "we", "us", or "our").

By creating an account, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

This document is provided for general informational purposes only and is not legal advice. You should consult your own legal counsel before relying on or publishing these Terms.

## 1. Eligibility and Use of the Service

To use the Service, you must:

- Be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction that allows you to consent to data processing and online services).
- Have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement with Setout Labs.
- Use the Service only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations.

If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms and that "you" refers to that organization.

## 2. Accounts and Security

To access certain features, you must create an account or sign in using a supported identity provider.

You agree to:

- Provide accurate, current, and complete account information.
- Maintain the security and confidentiality of your login credentials.
- Promptly notify us at `support@autonote.io` of any suspected unauthorized access or security incident.
- Be responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms or if your use poses a risk to the Service or other users.

## 3. Subscriptions, Free Trials, and Billing

Autonote may offer both free and paid features, including subscription plans ("Subscriptions").

### 3.1 Purchases through App Stores and Payment Providers

If you purchase a Subscription through Apple App Store, Google Play, or another authorized provider, your purchase is governed by their terms, conditions, and refund policies. We do not control and are not responsible for their billing practices.

To manage, cancel, or request a refund for a Subscription purchased through an app store, you must use that platform’s account settings or support channels.

### 3.2 Subscription Renewals and Cancellations

Unless otherwise stated at sign-up:

- Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period.
- The renewal price will be the price displayed at the time you first subscribed or as otherwise communicated to you before renewal.
- You can cancel your Subscription at any time in your Apple, Google, or other app store account settings or in the Service where supported.

Cancellations take effect at the end of the then-current billing period. We generally do not provide prorated refunds for partial billing periods, subject to applicable law and app store policies.

### 3.3 Price Changes and Taxes

We may change Subscription prices from time to time. Any changes will apply on the next billing period after we provide notice, in accordance with applicable law and platform rules.

Prices may exclude taxes, levies, or duties, which may be charged in addition and vary by location.

## 4. Your Content and Our License to Provide the Service

"Content" means any notes, notebooks, tags, templates, attachments, voice recordings, and other materials you upload, create, or store in Autonote, along with associated metadata.

### 4.1 Your Ownership

You retain all rights to the Content you add to the Service, subject to the rights granted in these Terms and any third-party rights in such Content.

### 4.2 License to Operate the Service

You grant Setout Labs a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, process, and display your Content solely as needed to operate, maintain, improve, and provide the Service to you and as otherwise described in our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md).

This includes, for example, syncing your notes across devices, backing up data, processing search and organization features, and supporting customer service.

### 4.3 Your Responsibilities

You are responsible for:

- The Content you add to the Service and ensuring you have all necessary rights to do so.
- Ensuring your Content does not infringe or violate any third-party rights, applicable laws, or these Terms.
- Maintaining your own backups of important Content where appropriate.

We do not routinely review Content but may remove or restrict access to Content that we reasonably believe violates these Terms or applicable law.

## 5. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Service for any unlawful, harmful, fraudulent, or misleading purpose.

Except for your Content, all rights, title, and interest in and to the Service—including software, user interfaces, design, text, graphics, logos, trademarks, and documentation—are owned by Setout Labs or our licensors and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws.

Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service for your personal or internal business purposes.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Service, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract source code, except as permitted by law.

## 7. Third-Party Services and Links

The Service may integrate with or link to third-party products, services, websites, or content (collectively, "Third-Party Services"), including identity providers, app stores, analytics tools, and sync or storage providers.

We do not control and are not responsible for Third-Party Services. Your use of Third-Party Services is governed by their own terms and privacy policies, not these Terms. We are not liable for any damages or losses arising from your use of Third-Party Services.

---

## 8. Termination and Account Deletion

You may stop using the Service at any time. You can delete your account using the in-app controls where available or by contacting us at `support@autonote.io` as described in our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md).

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service, or remove Content, if:

- You materially or repeatedly breach these Terms.
- Your use poses a security, legal, or operational risk to us or others.
- We are required to do so by law or by a platform provider.

Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease. Some obligations, such as those relating to intellectual property, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution, will survive termination.

## 9. Disclaimers

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

- The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory.
- We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, error-free, or that data loss will never occur.

Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit any warranty or right that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

- Setout Labs and our affiliates, officers, employees, and agents will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenues, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the Service.
- Our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the Service or these Terms will not exceed the greater of (a) the amount you paid for the Service in the 12 months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or (b) fifty U.S. dollars (USD $50).

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you to the extent prohibited by law.

## 12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms and any dispute arising out of or relating to them or the Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict-of-laws principles, except where mandatory law in your country of residence requires otherwise.

You and Setout Labs agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware, United States, to resolve any dispute arising from these Terms or the Service, except where applicable law provides you with a right to bring actions in your local courts.

Nothing in these Terms limits any rights you may have under consumer-protection laws that cannot be waived by contract.

---

## 13. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in our Service, business, or legal requirements.
